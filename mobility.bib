The method allows the coevolution, in a single process, of the \{RBFNs\} as the time series models, as well as the set of lags to be used for predictions, integrating two genetic algorithms with real and binary codification, respectively. The individuals of one population are radial basis neural networks (used as models), while sets of candidate lags are individuals of the second population. In order to test the behavior of the algorithm in a new context of a variable horizon, 5 different measures have been analyzed, for more than 30 different databases, comparing this algorithm against six existing algorithms and for seven different prediction horizons. Statistical analysis of the results shows that L-Co-R outperforms other methods, regardless of the horizon, and is capable of predicting short, medium or long horizons using real known values. "

Despite this, there is still not a clear view about the various requirements involved in modelling. This field of research was examined by disaggregating the process of developing shortterm traffic forecasting algorithms into three essential clusters: the determination of the scope, the conceptual process of specifying the output and the process of modelling, which includes several decisions concerning the selection of the proper methodological approach, the type of input and output data used, and the quality of the data. A critical discussion clarifies several interactions between the above and results in a logical flow that can be used as a framework for developing shortterm traffic forecasting models. }

However, research has found that it considers redundant prediction errors of component predictors when calculating their credits, which makes it quite impervious to the fluctuated accuracy of the component predictors. To address this problem, a new \{BCM\} has been developed here to improve the performance of the traditional BCM. It assumes that at one prediction interval, the traffic flow is correlated with the traffic flows of only a few previous intervals. With this assumption, the credits of the component predictors in the \{BCM\} are only accounted for by their prediction performance for a few intervals rather than for all intervals. Therefore, compared with the traditional BCM, the new \{BCM\} is more sensitive to the perturbed performance of the component predictors and can adjust their credits more rapidly, and better predictions are generated as a result. To analyze the relevancy between the historical traffic flows and the traffic flow at the current interval, the entropy-based grey relation analysis method is proposed in detail. Three single predictors, namely the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), Kalman filter (KF) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) are designed and incorporated linearly into the \{BCM\} to take advantage of each method. A numerical application demonstrates that the new \{BCM\} considerably outperforms the traditional \{BCM\} both in terms of accuracy and stability. "

Timely and accurate traffic forecasting results are necessary inputs for advanced traffic management systems (ATMS) and advanced traveler information systems (ATIS). Despite the proliferation of advanced methodologies, modeling the uncertainty of traffic conditions is still a challenge, especially during congested situations. This paper presents a hybrid model for multi-step ahead traffic flow forecasting in a freeway system with real-time traffic flow data. This proposed methodology forecasts traffic flow by decomposing the data into three modeling components: an intra-day or periodic trend by introducing the spectral analysis technique, a deterministic part modeled by the \{ARIMA\} model, and the volatility estimated by the GJR-GARCH model. The aim of this study is to provide deeper insights into underlining traffic patterns and to improve the prediction accuracy and reliability by modeling these patterns separately. The forecasting performance of the proposed hybrid model is investigated with real time freeway traffic flow data from Houston, Texas. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to unearth the underlying periodic characteristics and volatility nature of traffic flow data and show promising abilities in improving the accuracy and reliability of freeway traffic flow forecasting in multi-step ahead forecasting.

However, few studies take into account spatial and temporal travel time information simultaneously in the prediction approach. In this study, we proposed a spacetime diurnal (ST-D) method, which merges the spatial and temporal travel time information to obtain accurate short-term travel time prediction for freeway corridors under different traffic conditions. The proposed approach can take into account important characteristics of travel times: spatial and temporal correlation, diurnal pattern, and the nonnegativity of the travel time. We use two distributions to model the 5-min average travel time: a truncated normal distribution and a lognormal distribution. Contrary to the most existing methods that yield a point prediction of short-term travel time, this probabilistic modeling approach can overcome the drawbacks of the point prediction by fitting a probability distribution to describe the uncertainty of the future travel times, and from which prediction intervals can be calculated. We use minimum continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) estimation to numerically estimate the parameters in the prediction models. The ST-D method is examined using the travel time data collected on a segment along the US-290 in Houston, Texas. The proposed method provides prediction of travel time over 5-min intervals for up to 1 h in advance. It was found that travel time data from neighboring links along the freeway corridors can be efficiently used to obtain reliable short-term prediction of travel time. The study results suggest the ST-D method is more robust than the traditional vector autoregressive models. "

Classifying states of traffic condition as congestion and non-congestion, the present paper is focused on developing flexible and explicitly multivariate state space models for network flow rate and time mean speed predictions. Based on the spatialtemporal patterns of the congested and non-congested traffic, the \{NSS\} model and \{CSS\} model are developed by solving the macroscopic traffic flow models, conservation equation and PayneWhitham model for flow rate and time mean speed prediction, respectively. The feeding data of the proposed models are from historical time series and neighboring detector measurements to improve the prediction accuracy and robustness. Using 2-min measurements from urban freeway network in Beijing, we provide some practical guidance on selecting the most appropriate models for congested and non-congested conditions. The result demonstrates that the proposed models are superior to \{ARIMA\} models, which ignores the spatial component of the spatialtemporal patterns. Compared to the \{ARIMA\} models, the benefit from spatial contribution is much more evident in the proposed models for all cases, and the accuracy can be improved by 5.62\% on average. Apart from accuracy improvement, the proposed models are more robust and the predictions can retain a smoother pattern. Our findings suggest that the \{NSS\} model is a better alternative for flow rate prediction under non-congestion conditions, and the \{CSS\} model is a better alternative for time mean speed prediction under congestion conditions.

abstract={Accurate and timely traffic flow information is important for the successful deployment of intelligent transportation systems. Over the last few years, traffic data have been exploding, and we have truly entered the era of big data for transportation. Existing traffic flow prediction methods mainly use shallow traffic prediction models and are still unsatisfying for many real-world applications. This situation inspires us to rethink the traffic flow prediction problem based on deep architecture models with big traffic data. In this paper, a novel deep-learning-based traffic flow prediction method is proposed, which considers the spatial and temporal correlations inherently. A stacked autoencoder model is used to learn generic traffic flow features, and it is trained in a greedy layerwise fashion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep architecture model is applied using autoencoders as building blocks to represent traffic flow features for prediction. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the proposed method for traffic flow prediction has superior performance.},

                  stochastic, deterministic, and other numerical methods
                  through an abundance of worked examples and code,
                  covering the solution of systems of linear algebraic
                  equations and nonlinear equations as well as ordinary
                  differential equations and partial differential
                  equations.  It not only shows how to use R's powerful
                  graphic tools to construct the types of plots most
                  useful in scientific and engineering work, but also:

                  * Explains how to statistically analyze and fit data
                    to linear and nonlinear models

                  * Explores numerical differentiation, integration, and
                    optimization

                  * Describes how to find eigenvalues and eigenfunctions

                  * Discusses interpolation and curve fitting

                  * Considers the analysis of time serie

                  Using R for Numerical Analysis in Science and
                  Engineering provides a solid introduction to the most
                  useful numerical methods for scientific and
                  engineering data analysis using R.}
