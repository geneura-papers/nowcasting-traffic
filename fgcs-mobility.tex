\begin{abstract}

This paper presents a set of applications of an own mobility monitoring system addressing several problems in a Smart City scope.
This system tracks the movement of people and vehicles analysing the  radioelectric space, specifically, the  WiFi and Bluetooth signals emitted by personal (smartphones) or on-board (hands-free) devices.

The study has been conducted in four different real scenarios, i.e. with real data gathered by the system: two related with people's mobility (a public building and a discotheque); and two focused in traffic tracking (urban and intercity roads).

Different Data Mining techniques have been applied to extract useful knowledge, traffic forecasting methods to perform reliable predictions, and statistical analyses to model and validate the system accuracy (using different data sources).

The obtained results in all the cases show the viability and utility of the system, along with its multiple applications for solving real Smart City issues.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Nowadays, any system that collect reliable traffic information which is useful for wide population must be in mind for the society because the information increases the ability of improvement of any community. The information in our society is power and everybody tries to get it from any trustworthy source. Moreover, if this information is not available using any other previous commercial system, the innovation, the improvement and the success is guaranteed.

Traffic information is currently gathered using several kind of devices. The local, regional or national governments use these data aiming for improvements in the maintenance of roads and services, for computing useful traffic statistics, or to optimize the traffic light synchronization, among other uses. This information is considered in several ways, from improving the traffic flow inside the city to the end-users, drivers, who can profit by optimally planning their trips according to the current, or future, status of the traffic flow. Thus, gathered traffic information must be reliable and useful both, in real time and also in the near future, by means of forecasting tools, for instance.

The traffic monitors nowadays include pneumatic tubes, loop detectors, floating vehicles or automatic Optical Character Recognition (OCR) among others, but most of them are not able to identify and follow the same vehicle along the road network. In this paper we present a system able to do this while improving the quality of the gathered information and allowing the easy construction of traffic flow models or mobility graphs. In addition, the proposed system is formed by low-cost devices, which is another advantage over the usual monitoring systems, since the cost is an important factor for authorities which tend to install the simplest and cheapest monitors.

The device, a highly improved version of the one presented in \cite{castillo2014_book_sipesca}, is based in a single-board computer which monitors the radioelectric space catching Bluetooth (BT) and WiFi signals emitted by other devices. These will be mainly smartphones or hands-free systems on vehicles, which are detected and identified by means of their Media Access Control number (MAC) - which is unique - and stored as a traffic `step'.
% Antonio - ¿Se os ocurre un nombre mejor para los 'pasos'?
Thus, depending on the position of the monitoring device, we could gather information about specific people's or vehicles' displacements. In order to respect the person's privacy as well as data protection laws, the MAC is encrypted using a one-direction process before storing it, so, we cannot associate a captured MAC with any person.

The work presents four different scenarios centred in the city of Granada (Spain), in which real traffic/mobility data have been gathered. They are namely: a discotheque, a public building of the University, a highway between Granada and Málaga; and one of the main streets in the city.
Several devices or nodes have been deployed in each scenario.
The huge amount data produced have been deeply processed using \textit{Big Data} 
% Antonio - Meto también lo de Big Data que es otra 'palabra clave' del Special Issue. ;D. Antares, esto es Big Data, ¿no? :D
techniques, transforming or summarizing them, in order to conduct further analyses. Different methods have been applied, such as Data Mining, Time Series Forecasting, In/Out (Origin/Destination) matrices, or statistical procedures.
The aim was to extract useful information and reach clear conclusions in every scenario, proving the value of this monitoring system as a tool to improve different issues inside the city and buildings. Thus, the system would be suitable to be part of a \textit{Smart City}.

% Antonio - Hay que hacer referencias a Smart City a lo largo del paper. ;)

%%FERGU: la frase de este comentario es literal del paper de IoT, la uso abajo cambiada para justificar que lo nuestro es IoT: Main enabling factor of this promising paradigm is the integration of several technologies and communications solutions. Identification and tracking technologies, wired and wireless sensor and actuator networks, enhanced communication protocols. Abajo, la frase ya wena:
The use of these devices can be framed in the paradigm of Internet of Things (IoT), as we are integrating communications and technologies for identification and tracking, with the use of wireless sensors and actuator networks \cite{Atzori2010IoTSurvey}.

The rest of the work is structured as follows. Section \ref{sec:soa} presents the background and state of the art on the main topics of the work: traffic and mobility monitoring, traffic series forecast, and smart city tools, among others.
Then, our monitoring device is introduced in Section \ref{sec:mobywit}.
After this, there are four sections devoted to describe and analyze the different scenarios, namely: Section \ref{sec:disco} explains the discotheque scenario and the methods applied to its data, Section \ref{sec:etsiit} presents the study on the University building, Section \ref{sec:traffic} shows the analysis on the highway traffic, and Section \ref{sec:city} comments the scenario on the street of Granada.
Finally, Section \ref{sec:conclusions} plots the conclusions that we have reached in the work.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   STATE OF THE ART  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------


\section{Background and state of the art}
\label{sec:soa}

Several technologies are used to collect data and gather information about the 
state of the roads. Traffic monitoring technologies can be classified as 
\textit{intrusive}, installed in the pavement, and \textit{non-intrusive}, without contact with the road, causing minimal effect on the traffic flow \cite{martin2003detector}.

Main technologies currently used include pneumatic tubes, inductive loop 
detectors and automatic recognition systems (or OCR), among others 
\cite{rodrigue2013geography}.

Pneumatic tubes are placed on top of the lane to detect vehicles by the change 
in pressure generated when a vehicle passes over the tube. 
An inductive loop detector is a wire embedded into the roadway usually in a square configuration. An electric current is sent to the wire and when a metal surface with certain minimum area pass or is stopped above a pulse is triggered and detected. The main drawback of these two systems is that they are unable to identify the vehicle detected by the sensor. This way, the highly desired origin/destination matrices cannot be obtained. Just the number of vehicles and their type can be guessed. This count, although valuable, does not allow us to know many traffic flow characteristics like, for example, repetitive passes of the same vehicle. Because of their relatively high cost of installation and maintenance it is not feasible to install them all over our roads. That is why we can only see them on major roads, cities and points of special interest.

Finally, the automatic recognition technology has experienced an increase in 
recent years due to its ability to detect individual vehicles without relying 
on in-vehicle systems. Video image detection is a good example; in this case a 
trip line and/or tracking is used to record traffic data. Furthermore, they 
are used for automatic detection of incidents on the road. That is the main 
advantage over previous information systems. However, system reliability might 
not be the best, as weather may limit accuracy. Moreover, these systems are 
very expensive compared to the previously described \cite{skszek2001state}. 
Another problem has arisen recently with privacy. The Spanish Data Protection 
Agency (Agencia de Protección de Datos) considers the car license plate number 
as personal data. Thus, user consent is required for it to be saved.

There are many different companies working in the traffic information field. Some of the more relevant are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Bit Carrier \cite{mendez2011system,BitCarrier}: It offers a traffic 
management system based in BT to count people and commercial routes 
(pathsolver). Its technology was deployed in highways managed by Abertis for 
traffic flow control and monitoring. Actually it has a network of 150 devices 
in Catalonia (Spain) capable of tracking 200000 people every day.
\item Trafficnow \cite{Trafficnow}: Offers a traffic flow control centre for 
small towns. It requires a net of BT sensors. %A pilot experience has been deployed in Vigo.
\item Traffax Inc \cite{TraffaxInc}: It is a company that has also used 
BT for calculating origin/destination and transport time matrices.
\item Savari Networks \cite{SavariNetworks}: It offers the commercial 
product StreetWAVE for real-time traffic monitoring.
\item TrafficCast \cite{TrafficCast}: They have developed predictive models 
in different cities based on different technologies, such as video cameras, BT devices, and RFID tags included in the vehicles wanted to be followed.
\end{itemize}

% Antonio - Maribel, voy a recortar cosillas, que te enrollas incluso más que yo. No te enfades, porfa. XD
Traffic has been extremely exploited as a research field, mainly focused on the forecast of future flows considering the current information as a Time Series.
The forecasting of these flows in any transport system plays an important role for either alleviating urban congestion, or for adjust traffic control and guidance systems. The aim is to create an intelligent transportation system (ITS) which strongly depends on the capability to predict traffic conditions at least in the short-term (less than one hour into the future), since medium- and long-term predictions are barely accurate and reliable. These are nowadays a hard problem to solve in general Time Series \cite{ParrasGutierrez2014433}.
% Antonio - supongo que el medio y largo plazo no es que ayude, sería estupendo, sino que es muy difícil que sea preciso. ;)
% Antonio - quito la segunda referencia, ya que va de otras cosas y seguramente nos van a dar un toque por la extensión del artículo. :D
With a short-term forecasting the traffic control systems could be self-adapted continuously. For example, a traffic light could adjust its red or green time depending on the short-time forecasting of the closer streets. 

%Medium-term or long-term could to be useful if there are special conditions in a medium or long time period although nowadays the results of this research are not outstanding and it is an open question for many research groups, but usually in other subjects like time series in general \cite{ParrasGutierrez2014433} or economic development and political decisions \cite{longTermBussines2014}.

%La predicción del tráfico en una ciudad, una carretera o en general cualquier vía de transporte es esencial para mejorar el transporte. Los %usuarios de cualquier transporte público estarían más contentos si el flujo de tráfico de una ciudad cumpliera unos tiempos preestablecidos, puesto que así el transporte sería más rápido y eficiente. Sin embargo es un problema totalmente abierto en el que numerosos investigadores de todo el mundo realizan sus aportaciones. (Accurate and real-time traffic flow forecasting is essential to adaptive traffic control system and traffic guidance system, which is of great significance for alleviating urban traffic congestions. Because of the importance of traffic flow prediction results, many traffic engineering researchers began to apply mature prediction models of other areas to short-term traffic flow prediction and developed a variety of forecasting methods at the beginning of the 1960s. )

There are many works related with traffic flow forecasting, each of them approaching the problem with different models. These include: series models, Kalman Filter Theory, Markov Chain models, non-parametric methods, simulation models, local regression models, fuzzy-neural approaches, sequential learning, spectral analysis, Bayesian networks, neural networks, diffusion models or Big Data based approaches \cite{SurveyKumar2007}.  %(buscar referencias recientes de cada una y ponerlas si queremos ampliar este párrafo)
% Antonio - pos eso. ;D

% Existen numerosos trabajos relacionados con la predicción de tráfico y cada uno de ellos enfoca el problema de formas diferentes. Estos enfoques incluyen "series models, Kalman Filter Theory, Markov Chain models, non-parametric methods simulation models, local regression models, fuzzy-neural approaches, sequential learning, spectral analysis, Bayesian networks, neural networks, modelos de difusión o la técnicas de bigdata. (buscar referencias recientes de cada una y ponerlas)

Being the traffic flow forecasting a trending topic several surveys can be found, such as \cite{Survey2004} and \cite{SurveyKumar2007} but the best is \cite{SurveyBolshinsky2012}, since Bolshinsky and Friedman complete the information that the previous ones just compile, and give an added value to their work including the used techniques, the input data for each contribution, and the used hardware architecture, whenever the original paper described it. There are also specific surveys for one of the traffic flow forecasting types, like \cite{Vlahogianni2014} where the focus was not the approaches nor the results of the reviewed papers, but the focus or goals and the scope where each paper could be classified, for example if the work is focused on forecasting or presents the collecting data system as main contribution.

% Al tratarse de un tema muy estudiado, existen también numerosos resúmenes que te dan una idea general sobre este ámbito como el [SurveyKumar2007] publicado en el 2007 y centrado en la predicción del tráfico a corto plazo, o el publicado en 2012 por E. Bolshinsky [SurveyBolshinsky2012] donde se repasan las diferentes técnicas utilizadas, los datos de entrada que necesita cada una y algunas arquitecturas de los sistemas utilizados. También hay resúmenes específicos para un tipo de predicción como el propio [SurveyKumar2007] o [Vlahogianni2014] que tiene un enfoque un poco más generalista clasificando la literatura existente en los objetivos que perseguía cada trabajo o dentro de qué ambito estaba emarcado cada artículo, como por ejemplo si predecía el tráfico o predecía el tiempo esperado para un desplazamiento o estaba centrado en la forma de recolección de los datos utilizados.

During the last years, the researches even assimilate new technologies for data analysis like "Big Data" \cite{TrafficFlowPredictionWithBigData2015} or Cloud-Computing approaches \citep{CloudComputing2014}. In the first one, Yisheng et. al. face the traffic flow forecasting problem using temporal and spatial models at the same time, using simple forecasting models and assembling them in a global complex system. The results provide a time and a spatial place for each prediction. The second work, by Zhaosheng Yang et al., presents a traffic flow prediction model for large-scale road network using Cloud-Computing techniques. Thus, it implements successfully a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimizing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) getting a higher prediction accuracy and a smaller running time. 


%Algunos de los trabajos más recientes que versan sobre la predicción del tráfico intentan ya integrar nuevas tecnologías como "Big Data" [TrafficFlowPredictionWithBigData2015] donde intentan abarcar nuevos enfoques en la predicción incluyendo una predicción temporal y espacial simultáneamente utilizando modelos de predicción simples como piezas que forman un sistema mucho más complejo.

Several recent publications present spacial issues related with the scope, such as \cite{Zhang20141}, which includes the last advances in traffic forecasting research. 
% Antonio - ¿como cuáles?
Other works propose conducting forecast traffic flows and trip times \citep{Dong201420}, \cite{Zou201433} using spatial-temporal patterns of the congested and non-congested traffic. Also papers with new real-time forecasting approaches \cite{Zhang201465} or improved and renewed proposals such as \cite{Wang201479}, which improves the Bayesian combination method (BCM) proposed by Petridis et al. in 2001, or \cite{Qi201495} which improves freeways short-term prediction using a Markov Model.

%También existen numerosas revistas que proponen números especiales que versan sobre este tema [Zhang20141], donde se puede encontrar los últimos avances que intentan ir más allá y predecir no sólo el estado del tráfico sino el tiempo de los desplazamientos [Dong201420] [Zou201433]  utilizando modelos espacio-temporales del tráfico en diferentes situaciones (spatial?temporal patterns of the congested and non-congested traffic) o trabajos que le dan una vuelta de tuerca más a las técnicas y proponen nuevos métodos de predicción [Zhang201465] utilizando datos del tráfico en tiempo real o métodos ya conocidos y mejorados como [Wang201479][Qi201495].

In the present work, a study on traffic forecasting is conducted (in Section \ref{sec:traffic}), however it applies classical methods, because the aim is to show the value of the data gathered by our system in the comparison with the data collected by the Spanish Traffic Agency using an inductive loop detector, which is also studied.
Thus, our contribution on this line is the use of real traffic Time Series, created from the data extracted from our traffic `steps' (WiFi and BT detections).

% Antonio - he movido este texto que es más de background a esta sección. ;)
% TODO: GUSTAVO, ¿podrías poner citas a esos temas? ;D
% te perdono pero sólo por esta vez :D
Another line of study in our paper is the personal tracking or people's mobility. It is studied for many reasons, several of them involve profit: conversion rate, marketing effectiveness or staff planning are some of the best known.
% Antonio - Citas, citas everywhere. Plis, Gustavo. :D

Conversion rate is the percentage of visitors 
% Antonio - ¿customers?
who effectively make a purchase. It can show you if a shop improvement (or decline) is due to more people visit it, or more of the visitors finally buy something. Shopping mall professionals study people's behaviour in order to know if their marketing techniques are paying off. In the same line, stuff planning is directly related with the amount of visitors, as well as the maintenance and cleaning needs.

Other reasons are more practical than commercial: How many people visit a public building? When? It will help to improve the planning of the provided services, heating or cooling of the building, facility cleaning, staff shifts and so on. In a museum or a sport stadium you can adjust many parameters to help people enjoy from a better experience while raising the profits.

The technology for counting/tracking people has evolved over time. At the beginning infrared beam counters were used. 
% Antonio - cita o referencia a URL
These were cheap but prone to failures, like when two persons pass a door together. Thermal counters were used next. 
% Antonio - cita o eso
Also cheap but with serious limitations like the short distance from the counting device to the people being counted. Latest technology use video cameras and WiFi, or Bluetooth, detectors. 
% Antonio - esto es importante, habría que extenderlo y compararlo con lo nuestro, ya que se podría parecer. Aparte de la cita. ;D
Video devices are more expensive as is the software in charge of image processing, more expensive in term of resource consumption. On the positive side, now we can do many more things than counting people. We can track their paths and behaviour. Radio signal is also a great method for people tracking, as powerful as video but cheaper in terms of hardware price and algorithmic cost. Moreover, the range of detection is wider, 100m approximately.

Our approach is based on WiFi and BT detection, but focused on people's personal devices from which an unique identifier can be extracted and (after anonymisation) stored. This makes it easy to track these people on a building for instance, just deploying a fair number of monitoring devices. With the advantage of the cheaper price than other systems, such as video, and also the possibility of create in/out (origin/destination) matrices 
% Antonio - Gustavo, una cita, po favó. ;D
or accurate movement models.

\section{MOBYWIT}
\label{sec:mobywit}

This device was designed by one of the authors and it is based in a single-board computer, Raspberri Pi\footnote{https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry\_Pi}. It has two USB cards, namely a Bluetooth (BT) and WiFi ones, and it uses their interfaces in monitor mode, scanning the radioelectric space searching for BT devices and beacon frames (for WiFi).

Every device, called MOBYWIT (Mobility by Wireless Tracking) is formed by a hardware and a software layer very interconnected. It is part in the whole monitoring system, which also includes Cloud-based storage and computing services. The software architecture of the whole system is shown in Figure \ref{fig:mobywit}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{imgs/mobywit.eps}
		\caption{Monitoring system architecture}
	\label{fig:mobywit}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

As it can be seen in that figure, there are six main parts in the software layer of the system, which are unidirectionally connected by a strict data flow. They are have been named as:
\begin{itemize}

\item \textit{Raziel}: This module is in charge of the detections of BT and WiFi devices as well as of their identification (extracting and encrypting the MAC) and the periodic submission of this information to the server. It is run in the device and implemented in Java.

\item \textit{Lilith}: This module acts as a gateway between the network of devices and the server. It allows the communications between nodes and between them and external networks. This component is also run in every device and implemented in PHP.

\item \textit{Abdiel}: This component implements a set of services for accessing the devices from `outside' (mainly for activate/deactivate or update them). In addition it performs the storage of gathered data (in blocks) in the server database. It is also implemented in PHP.

\item \textit{Alejandría}: This is the database of the system. It is a MySQL instance placed in a local server. It is optimized (using indexes and table partitioning) to provide a close to real-time processing and data service.
Ezequiel: This module is responsible of the publication of data in a cloud-based storage. It includes data mining, machine learning and forecast techniques to process these data in order to publish interesting or useful information about them.

\item \textit{Anan}: This is the cloud-based storage and services. It is based in Google technology so Anan stores and manages the data in a NoSQL format, by means of Google Fusion Tables. It also offers advanced visualization methods to be more usable and attractive for the end-user of the system.

\end{itemize}

In addition, and as it is shown in Figure 1, the device runs an specific Operative System, called \textit{Horeb}, which is a modification of the original Raspbian 3.10.24, adapted by MOBYWIT system designer to be more robust (to power fails, for instance) and reliable.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   PEOPLE'S MOBILITY IN A DISCO  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Analysis of people's mobility in a discotheque}
\label{sec:disco}

In the first scenario of this work, a Discotheque has been monitored using five MOBYWIT devices, deployed one in every of the three main rooms (each room devoted to a type of music), one on the main entrance, and one in the terrace.
% Antonio - JJ, revisa y completa esto, por favor

A total of 2200 different devices were detected in one of the busy nights (from a Thursday at 8 pm to Friday at 8 am), distributed per node as it is shown in Figure \ref{fig:disco_data}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{center}

	\end{center}
\end{figure}
% Antonio - Antares porfa, genera la gráfica correctas. ;)
% TODO: ANTARES - Gráfica correcta

These data have been processed and several variables have been extracted from them, in order to apply clustering methods.

The clustering study has been conducted by means of a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) \cite{Kohonen90}, a feed-forward neural network \cite{NN_Haykin94} that uses an unsupervised training algorithm and nonlinear regression techniques to learn or find unknown relationships among the set of variables that describe a problem. The main property of the SOM is that it makes a nonlinear projection from a high-dimensional data space on a regular, low-dimensional (usually 2D) grid of neurons, called units. This grid can be later processed to obtain the unified distance matrix (U-matrix) \cite{UmatUlts} which uses SOM yielded neurons' codevectors (vectors of variables of the problem) as data source, and generates a matrix where each component is a distance measure between two adjacent neurons. Then, these distances are codified as different color shades in a graph.
The U-Matrix graph allows visualize any multi-variable dataset in a two-dimensional display, which helps detecting topological relations among neurons and inferring about the input data structure in a straightforward visual manner. High values in the U-matrix represent a frontier region between clusters, and low values represent a high degree of similarities among neurons on that region, i.e. clusters. MATLAB 2009 along with SOM Toolbox \cite{SOMPAK} was used for the SOM analysis.

In order to analyze the data, several features have been extracted (generated) from the gathered `steps', composing a pattern per device of its whole stay in the disco. These are described in Table \ref{tab:features_disco}.

\begin{table}[htpb]
\centering
{\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{lll}

\texttt{stay\_time} & Number of seconds the device has been in the disco & Integer\\
\texttt{abs\_time\_node\_X} & Number of seconds the device has been detected\\
& in every node X (from 1 to 5) & Integer\\
\texttt{relat\_time\_node\_X} & Percentage of time the device has been detected\\

\texttt{relat\_night\_time\_node\_X} & Percentage of time the device has been detected\\

\noalign{\smallskip}\hline
\end{tabular}
 \caption{Extracted features from gathered data in the discotheque. \label{tab:features_disco}}

\end{table}


The application of SOM + U-Matrix produces the graphs shown in Figure

The results show that... *** COMENTARLOS ***
The problem is that there are no labels on the graph, so the interpretation cannot be as complete as it could... ***


In addition, another study has been conducted using SOM and U-MATRIX graphs. This time we want to analyze the \textit{recurrence of devices} to the discotheque, and their overall behaviour in the days they have come back. To this aim a new dataset has been composed, extracting those `steps' of devices detected in more than two nights in two whole months.
For each device, we have computed a sum of the amounts of diary time per monitoring node. Relative times have been also calculated as another set of features. There are 220000 monitored `steps' and 2100 different devices, so this amount of patterns to cluster.

We have labelled the data using the number of different days every device has been detected (the recurrence rate).

The results on this study are shown in Figure \ref{fig:som_disco_recurrencia}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

*** PONER GRÁFICA CON DATOS Y VARIABLES DEFINITIVAS ***

As it can be seen in the U-Matrix every neuron (cell in the graph) has been labelled according to the class of the majority of the most similar input patterns. To this end the distance from every pattern to every neuron is computed considering their respective codevectors, the closest neuron to an input is named the best matching unit (BMU), and it is labelled with the pattern class (stage in this problem). Once the process has finished every neuron with more than one associated class finally displays the label with more occurrences.

\section{Analysis of people's mobility in a building of the University}
\label{sec:etsiit}

In this section we will focus on people's mobility, as explained in Section \ref{sec:soa}, in a public building: the School of Informatics (ETSIIT) at the University of Granada. The building is studied as a proof of concept for the MOBYWIT sensor described in section \ref{sec:mobywit}. In order to monitor people flow, three devices have been placed in the three accesses to the building, as it can be seen on Figure \ref{fig:etsiit_map}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\begin{center}

		\caption{MOBYWIT devices location in ETSIIT}
		\label{fig:etsiit_map}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Since the devices can detect BT and WIFI signals from both the university staff and the students, two of them has been placed very close of the main access trying to distinguish staff (62) from students (52). The parking door (42) can only be used by the staff.

The devices has been recording data for a few days only. With these data the origin/destination histogram that can be seen in figure \ref{fig:etsiit_io} has been created. A careful examination of this figure let us extract some conclusions.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

		\caption{Origin/Destination histogram of people in ETSIIT}

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item Most people are students and they access the building through the students door (sensor 52 in figure \ref{fig:etsiit_map}). Most people get in and out by this door.
\item Professors and administrative staff seem to divide their way of getting in and out. They used the parking (sensor 42) as much as the main building door (sensor 62).
\item Many students go out by the main building (62) after a supposedly visit to a professor or an administrative.
\item Some curious behavior has been discovered: some students who enter by their door (42) exit by the parking (52). The only explanation possible is that the cafeteria and the lunch room are in the basement and they can get out without getting up one floor.
\item Why people getting in by main door (62) almost never go out by the same door? Most of them are students and go out by their door (52) at the end of the classes.
\end{itemize}

With some additional sensors the people flow could be studied in a better way. Because with the three used many people can not be correctly interpreted as the right kind of visitor. The most interesting place for a new sensor is in the door of the classroom building at the north in the map.

\section{Analysis of the traffic in a highway}
\label{sec:traffic}

This section describes the experimental analysis of the data gathered by a different number of devices placed in national highways.

The main difference with respect to the other experimental scenarios is that, in this case, the detected devices are cars moving at higher speed. However, in this scenario we also count with the information provided by the Spanish traffic management agency, Direcci\'on General de Tr\'afico (DGT), which is collected using loop detectors. So, in this case, we have used real data in order to validate our approach by comparing the real number of vehicles which has passed a point, with the number of devices detected by MOBYWIT. Thus, a realistic \textit{ratio} between both numbers has been computed.

Six nodes have been placed along different roads in Andalusia (south Spain). Figure \ref{fig:nodosDGT} shows the identifiers of these devices and their exact location. These locations have been chosen because are the nearest ones to existent loop detectors monitored by the DGT, and also, they have Internet connection to allow the transmission of data to our server.

\subsection{Data validation using other sources of data}

Different metrics will be used to obtain a correct correlation between the number of detected devices and the real number detected by the loop detectors.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Total ratio}: ratio between the total number of vehicles detected by the DGT and the total number of vehicles detected by our device.
\item {\em Average of ratios}: as the maximum granularity of the data provided by the DGT is 15 minutes, the sum of all ratios between the DGT data and our data in each 15 minutes section has been divided by the total number of sections to calculate the average.
\item {\em Median ratio}: instead the average ratio as in previous metric, this one uses the median of all ratios.
\item {\em Time ratio}: this metric calculate a vector of ratios separated by hour of the day, instead obtaining a global ratio for all data. An average ratio per hour in the vector is calculated taking into account all the ratios of that hour during all the days we have data.
\item {\em Time median}: as in the previous metric, this one uses a vector of ratios per hour, but every element is calculated using the median, instead the average.
\end{itemize}


Figure \ref{fig:dgtRatios} shows the number of devices of one node, applying the chosen correction ratio.

\section{Analysis of the urban traffic in a city}
\label{sec:city}

% TODO: MARIBEL + ANTARES

The information Mobywit device is able to provide for urban scope is amazing, but we are mainly interesting in two goals: to measure the trip time among several points in a city and the path the drivers follow across the city to arrive the closer highway. Both goals are the interest area of the local city council, so we start to monitoring the city for achieving them. 

Traffic jams usually are present in every town and it could be produced by diverse reasons. There are several papers which classify the traffic jam causes, \cite{CausasAtascos1}\cite{CausasAtascos2}, but they have been studied in particular cities. Therefore we can not apply the solutions provided by the authors of these papers to any city, we can solve the problem for a particular city taken the previous studies as starting point for our case and getting the good ideas for our case. A traffic jam is produced when the way or the street capacity is overflow for any reason during some time. Whatever the cause of the overflow, whether an unusual reason as a traffic accident, or a cause that remains over time as vehicle increasing around a new city area, drivers should avoid the area of the jam.

%La utilidad de Mobywit dentro del ámbito urbano es la identificación de rutas y la medición de tiempos de desplazamiento entre diversos puntos de la ciudad. En todas las ciudades hay atascos. Un atasco se puede producir por diversas causas y hay varios estudios que los han analizado en ciudades concretas \cite{CausasAtascos1,CausasAtascos2}. Pero si nos centramos en una sola ciudad quizas el analisis es muy concreto, por lo que debemos abstraer y quedarnos con la idea principal que es que los atascos se producen en cualquier situación en la que la capacidad de una determinada via en un momento concreto se ve superada. Sea cual sea la causa de esta superación, una causa puntual, como un accidente que ha limitado la capacidad, o una causa permanente en el tiempo, como por ejemplo un crecimiento del parking móvil de una determinada zona, se debe evitar la zona del atasco.

When a driver finds himself in a traffic jam, the natural response is to plan another path to arrive his destination and the information about another available path is appreciated by them. The selection of another path depends on driver destination and it could be different for each case. So, the first stage is to inform about the traffic jam and then the drivers decide to go across or miss it. The second stage is to provide the available paths and to turn off the vehicles but this option is not always possible. 


%Ante una situacion de atasco, cualquier conductor busca vias alternativas y en muchos casos la informacion de esas vias alternativas es muy importante. Pero dependiendo del destino de cada vehiculo, la via alternativa a escoger podria ser diferente, por lo que las autoridades, lo que hacen es informar del atasco antes de llegar a el para que sean los conductores los que busquen las vias alternativas de desplazamiento. En cualquier caso, la primera acción es determinar en qué momento se empieza a producir el atasco para que los conductores sean informados y puedan tomar una decisión en consecuencia. Y la segunda acción es identificar las rutas que los conductores más utilizan para poder desviar al tráfico de la manera más eficaz.


To illustrate the Mobywit utility for the first stage, early detection of a traffic jam is essential, and a little experiment has been carried out in Granada city (Spain). We have installed two Mobywit devices in the same street. The device's location is Dr. Ol\'{o}riz street. It is one-way, has four lanes and is placed in a neighbourhood which regularly is collapsed. The map of the devices location is in Figure \ref{fig:mososMapa}. The distance among both nodes is about $168$ metres. These devices cannot detect all the real persons and vehicles moving close to them since not all of them emit BT or WiFi signals, however after an open poll which $600$ people answered we conclude that around the $22\%$ of the drivers emit BT and around the $70\%$ of the drivers emit WiFi signal. We consider the figure is good and representative of the real traffic flows. For this starting experiment, we measure the taken time to go from the first to the second Mobywit device for each counted people. The results of this experiment are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:mososTiempo}.
